<h1>How to optimize a ThreeJS game for mobile platforms</h2>

Launching a browser game for mobile is a daunting task.
Your game has to be very simple in terms of graphics for it to render with acceptable FPS.
Your dealing with a very low amount of RAM and a painful debugging process.

<h2>Catching the bottleneck</h2>

<h2>Draw calls</h2>
<p>
    I have covered the topic of optimizing a scene in terms of draw calls

<h2>Memory</h2>

    The amount of RAM in modern mobile devices vary between 256MB to 2048MB.
    How much memory your game will consume is up to you but I'd keep it at most around 70MB.
    How to track memory???????
