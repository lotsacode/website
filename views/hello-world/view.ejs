<p>
I have a new programming blog, and you're looking at it. I post useful things about programming here and advertise some of my stuff. There's a comment box so feel free to comment. I'm currently working with HTML5/Javascript and I'm interested in computer graphics, statistics, web development and electronics.

	The website was made from scratch (no CMS). I'm hosting it at home with an old PC. 
	I use <a href="https://www.nginx.com">nginx</a> to route HTTP from port 80 to NodeJS applications running on port 900X.
	The backend is using <a href="https://expressjs.com">Express</a> and templating with <a href="http://www.embeddedjs.com">EJS</a>. I have uploaded the code to Github, you can look at it <a href="https://github.com/lotsacode/website">here</a>.
