<h1>Hello World</h1>

<p>
	I have a new website and you're looking at it.
	I plan to write useful things about programming here and
	advertise some of my stuff. There's a comment box so feel free to comment.
</p>
<p>
	The website was made from scratch (no CMS). I'm hosting it at home with an old PC.
	I use <a href="https://www.nginx.com">nginx</a> to route HTTP from port 80 to NodeJS.
	The setup is pretty simple, I'm using <a href="https://expressjs.com">Express</a>
	and templating with <a href="http://www.embeddedjs.com">EJS</a>.
	The code is in Github, you can look at it <a href="https://github.com/lotsacode/website">here</a>.

<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>
	I'm currently working with HTML5/Javascript and interested in computer graphics, statistics, web development and electronics.
	Currently I'm studying computer science at college and always up for freelance programming work.
	Feel free to contact me if you need help with your project.
